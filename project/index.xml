      <description>NIH/NIA (R21_AG045735) - $275,000
The goal of this exploratory fMRI and psychophysical study is to compare pain processing in a broad range of adults (ages 30-89) to see how the response to pain and brain function differ with sex and aging, to provide a foundation for developing improved pain treatment methods for older adults.</description>

      <description>American Academy of Nursing/BAGNC, May Day Fund - $5,000
The goal of this comparative group study is to examine how sensory and affective components of pain in women with Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease are psychophysically and neurophysiologically associated, as compared to matched controls. The proposed study will also examine associations relative to AD severity.</description>

      <description>Vanderbilt VICTR (KL2) - $450,000
Examining the psychophysical and neurophysiological response to pain stimuli in communicative patients with Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease. Using fMRI analysis, we are able to determine regions of activation that correspond to the thermal pain we apply to participants while they undergo a 3T fMRI. The fMRI procedure is coupled with psychophysics and various questionnaires to determine affect, potential for depression, and overall pain experienced by the participant</description>
